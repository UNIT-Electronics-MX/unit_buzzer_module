# UNIT Buzzer Module

* This module is a compact, easy-to-use **passive** buzzer component designed for embedded systems and prototyping. It features a standardized 3-pin interface: **VCC (5V)**, **Signal**, and **GND**, allowing seamless integration with a variety of microcontrollers, such as `Arduino`, `ESP32`, `CH552`, and `STM32` boards.

* The buzzer onboard can generate audible signals for use in **alarms**, **notifications**, **timers**, and **user feedback systems**. Its design includes a pre-mounted drive circuit, enabling direct digital control from microcontroller GPIO pins.
