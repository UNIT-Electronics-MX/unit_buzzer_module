# Buzzer Examples

This directory contains practical examples demonstrating how to use a **buzzer** in embedded and programming environments.

## Structure

The folder is organized by programming language to provide clean and language-specific examples:


Each subfolder includes ready-to-run code snippets and comments to help you understand how to control buzzers to play simple tones or melodies.

## Purpose

This collection aims to:

- Serve as a reference for controlling buzzers through code
- Provide educational examples for electronics and embedded programming
- Support both microcontroller-based C programming and higher-level scripting with Python

## Notes

- All examples are provided **as-is** and intended for **educational purposes only**.
- Please verify the hardware compatibility (e.g., pins and voltage levels) before uploading or running the code.
- Feel free to contribute by adding more examples or improving existing ones!

> ⚠️ Use all code at your own risk. The authors are not responsible for hardware damage or unintended behavior.
